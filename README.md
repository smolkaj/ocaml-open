# ocaml-open: open files in their default applications

[![Build Status](https://github.com/smolkaj/ocaml-open/workflows/build%20and%20test/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/smolkaj/ocaml-open/actions)

Conveniently open files such as PDFs in their default applications straigt from OCaml.

## Quick start
You can install the library using `opam`:
```
$ opam install open
```
Then in `utop` or `ocaml`,
```
$ ocaml
> #require "open";;
> Open.in_default_app "/home/steffen/ocaml.svg";;
- : bool = true
// SVG viewer opens and displays ocaml.svg
```
![OCaml](http://ocaml.org/logo/Colour/SVG/colour-logo.svg)

The boolean returned by `Open.in_default_app` indicates whether the open command exited normally:
```
> Open.in_default_app "/path/to/non-existent.file";;
- : bool = false
// nothing happens
```

Both absolute and relative paths are supported:
```
> Open.in_default_app ".";;
- : bool = true
// file manager displays current working directory
```

## API
The tiny API is documented [here](https://smolkaj.github.io/ocaml-open/).

## Building from source

### Dependencies
The library requires [`dune`](https://github.com/ocaml/dune) (formerly known as jbuilder) to build, but has no other dependencies.

### Building Library and Examples
Run `make` to build and `make test` to see the library in action. This should open several files from the `examples/basic` folder.

There is also a more sophisticated example in `examples/graphviz` that requires graphivz and Jane Street's [`core`](https://opensource.janestreet.com/core/) (version v0.9.0 or higher). You can build & run it as follows:
```
dune build @graphviz
```

## Limitations and Implementation
The library has been tested under Linux, MacOS, and Cygwin. There is experimental support for native Windows, but this is untested.
The implementation uses
* `xdg-open` on Linux
* `open` on MacOS
* `cygstart` on Cygiwn, and
* `cmd start` on Windows.
